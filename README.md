## Introduction

In this project, we delve into different sorting algorithms, analyze their strengths and weaknesses, and examine their time and space complexities. Sorting algorithms covered in this project include, but are not limited to:

- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort

By studying and comparing these sorting algorithms, we gain insights into their practical applications, identify scenarios where each algorithm excels, and make informed decisions regarding algorithm selection based on the input size and efficiency requirements.

## Sorting Algorithms

Each sorting algorithm covered in this project will have its own dedicated folder within the repository. Inside each folder, you will find:

- Source code implementation in a programming language of choice (such as Python, Java, or C++)
- Explanation of the algorithm's working principles
- Analysis of time complexity and space complexity
- Examples demonstrating the algorithm in action

Feel free to explore the different algorithms, their implementations, and accompanying explanations to deepen your understanding of sorting techniques.

## Big O Notation

Understanding the time and space complexities of algorithms is crucial when it comes to evaluating their efficiency. This project includes a detailed explanation of Big O notation, a common mathematical notation used to describe the upper bound of an algorithm's running time or space requirements. By studying the Big O complexities of the sorting algorithms discussed, you will gain insights into their scalability and performance characteristics.
